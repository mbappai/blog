Bigger trees grow much faster than smaller plants; Why is that?  

Well bigger trees have bigger and wider roots, bigger trees have been in existence waay longer than smaller trees while on the other
hand, smaller or newly planted trees struggle to adapt to the environment to spread their roots  

This same concept applies professionally. Senior engineers often grow much faster than junior engineers not because they are smarter 
but because they have been in the field long enough to know how to learn things faster and more efficiently than Juniors.  

A junior is still usually still stuck at trying to even learn how they learn and absorve overwhelming information at a fast pace.  

A senior knows how to learn just the right stuff in order to get them started while a junior only feels ready after consuming the entire 
content about the stuff at hand.
