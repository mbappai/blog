Truly everything is in the hands of Allah. One minute in your life everything is going fine as though nothing will ever happen to you
and the next minute everything comes crashing down.

It's been exactly a week since my whole team got laid off, never expected that to happen as I sort of recently got promoted to Devrel.

Everything happened in an instant, not enough time to even process it.

The honest truth is that, after everything that happened, I still deeply respect the company and it's leadership, I know it wasn't an easy
decision to make, yet it was made nevertheless and I have accepted that. I wish for them all the best of luck in this world

### Lessons

**Own your shit** - Always have your own thing going for you. Who are you outside work? You need to create your own reputation, your own projects
something you own to showcase who you are as person and professional

**Learn to network like hell** - The worst time for you to start reaching out to people in hopes of making a connection is when you
need something from them. Build your network both online and offline and more importantly be checking in with them from time to time.
Don't also limit yourself from only networking with high-class individuals(do it by all means if you get the chance), but more importantly
you want to treat everyone with respect, because a junior engineer today is going to be a director some day.

**Apply for jobs when you don't need them** - Is always good to keep your interviewing skill sharpened all the time. This is a common
mistake by most people where they only seek to interview when they are in need of Job, that could never be farther from the truth. interviewing
with other companies never doesn't mean you don't like your current company, it's just a matter of being up to speed about the interview process
and also helps you know your worth in job market and if you ever get fortunate to get a better offer, you have the option of negotiating a higher
salary in your current company or moving to the new company. I made this mistake in that I got too comfortable where I worked and hardly
entertained the idea of interviewing with other companies, because it felt as though I found a home.
