If I was to ever enforce a guideline for building frontends with nextJS, this would be it

## Colocation

Bring components, utilities and libs very close to where they are being implemented for better maintainability and searchability. In nextjs14, that could easily be achieved
by creating folders in any route segment like so

```
 settings
    -- componenets
    -- utilities
    -- data
    page.tsx

 dashboard
    -- componenets
    -- utilities
    -- data
    page.tsx
```
