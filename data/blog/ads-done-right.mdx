I was in the middle of playing a video game called hay day created by supercell when I noticed a very interesting way they advertise on the platform.

Usually on every site, you tend to see that the only benefactor of an advertisement is the platform itself because they get the reward of users viewing or clicking the ads while the user gets stuck with the entire
inconvenience  

So what hay day does is that they only show you ads on *demand*. Not only that, you only get to benefit from watching the ad.

For those that don't know the game, it's basically a game about you managing and developing your farm. You get to have rear different animals as well as establish production machines
such as diary factory, bakery, oven and what not. 

Work in progress...
