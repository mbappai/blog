One needs to be very proactive these days. Its no longer enought to just apply to every job posting out there hoping to get something positive
out of that, I'm not saying it never works, but the probability of that is much lower because there are sooo many other people applying
for that same postion and those people could possibly have waaay more experience than you do. So what makes you think you'll get the job?  

Job hunting is a skill in it's self that you have to be good at. You have to be creative and proactive about it.  

Here is an [example of one guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=xgCh7_YUoBE) I came across on youtube that was very smart about it and ended up getting him the job with little experience.

#### Low effort job hunting

This is where someone spends their precious time applying to every single job posting out there without taking time to even read the 
job description, often only interested in whether or not the role matches what they're looking for. Some of them "go the extra mile" to
read the requirements before applying but thats it, cover letter and resume often generic.

#### Medium effort

This is a step up from low effort where the candidate is a bit more interested in the company and reads the job description and every other thing
on the job post.

#### High effort

This is a step up from low effort where the candidate is a bit more interested in the company and reads the job description and every other thing
on the job post.
