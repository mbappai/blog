I always make the mistake of starting to put pixels on a screen without properly defining art direction for the project.
To give you an example, I can't remember the number of times I attempted to design my website without specifying how I want it to feel.
This had made me design aimlessly, always second guessing my choices.  

The reality was, the fact that I had no direction, almost every idea I had was entertained, every typeface combination felt like the next
best option, not until I finally settled down and decided what I wanted.  

I want my site to reflect my personality. These are the traits I came up of with 

- Whimsy: This is by far one of the most important to me because I like to believe I am very playful most of the time
- Attention-to-detail: As whimsy as I am, I tend to be a little bit of a perfectionist which makes me notice the small things
often overlooked by a lot (which makes me quite annoying sometimes)
- Simple: Form should always follow function. I rearly like things that are too cosmetic. I will always pick something that is simple
and functional by design
- Timeless: A timeless design is most of the time much easier to maintain. I want something that could stand the test of time. I wouldn't want
to always feel the need to change it after a short period of time.
