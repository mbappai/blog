Bring components, utilities and libs very close to where they are being implemented for better maintainability and searchability. In nextjs14, that could easily be achieved
by creating folders in any route segment like so

```
... 

 settings
    -- componenets
    -- utilities
    -- styles
    -- types
    -- data
    page.tsx

 dashboard
    -- componenets
    -- utilities
    -- hooks
    -- styles
    -- types
    -- data
    page.tsx
```

Doing this makes it much easier when it comes to reducing redundancy in your project because when you decide to remove everything related to
the settings page of the product, you just do it in one place instead of opening up every other folder in search of dependencies.
