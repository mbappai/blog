summary: 'You either get it done now or suffer the consequences later'

Every single time you push a task or work you're supposed to do now to a later point in the future, what you're essentially doing is making
a trade between the rest you're supposed to have in the future with work you have to do now. You just switched their places, you'll still meet it
later in the future.

As we grow older, our responsibilities usually increase, leaving use with less time to handle the work that got postponed due to our lack of
discipline.

So don't be lazy, discipline yourself and do the work now! You'll thank yourself later
