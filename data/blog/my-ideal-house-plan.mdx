 > It is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, of all things physical and metaphysical, of all things human and all
 things superhuman, of all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul, 
 that the life is recognizable in its expression, that form ever follows function. This is the law.

If I were to ever design and build a house for myself and my family, this is how it'll be.

I'm going to start off listing all the spaces and utilities I would like for the house to have

PS: This is a growing list.

### Indoor spaces

1. **Master bedroom** - Doesn't have to be too big. I prefer a room I can fit in just my bed and wardrobe, that's it. Then
there will be a small walk-in closet for my stuff and at the end of it is where I will have my bathroom. I would like a nice shower place, sink and a simple
toilet seat; nothing fancy like a jacuzzi or automated toilet seats. I'd also like small rack in the bathroom to keep one or two books
with a pen and paper to take notes when those ideas starts to roll-in (Lets admit it, the best ideas come to you when you're seated on the toilet)

2. **Queens bedroom** - It will have a similar set up like mine, but it'll be bigger for obvious reasons

3. **Public Living room** - A general living room for everyone in the house including visitors to hang out in. This will be located close
to the entrance of the house to receive visitors and handle any other business.

4. **Public living room toilet** - This will be a small and cozy space for visitors or any other person to quickly freshen up and relief themselves.
Nothing fancy here as well, just a toilet seat and an adequate faucet sink with a clean mirror.

5. **Indoor Kitchen** - Yes, you read it correctly - an indoor kitchen where gourmet and quick meals will be prepared for the family and guest as well. this
kitchen will house the gas cooker, air fryers, blenders, fridge and other electric appliances.

6. **Dinning table** - This will be located some where between the public living room and the _indoor kitchen_. Though I will like it if there's a little separation
between the two of the aformentioned spaces with a nice corridor

7. **Home office** - I like a small to medium size space for my home office because I don't intend to have a lot of things inside it. I just
need to have a nice desk and a comformtable and ergonomic char like Herman miller or Steelcase

8. **Guest room and bathroom** - Something simple for visitors.

9. **Prayer room and study** - A small to medium size space that will double as my mini library and small space for me to set up my praying mat to pray.
This room should be close to the masterbedroom.

10. **Box room** - A storage facility for things like our travelling boxes, extra blankets, shoes boxes, and some other things

11. **Pantry** - A storage facility located inside the kichten for condiments, food containers and other things

### Outdoor spaces

**Outdoor Kitchen** - This is where all meals that require the use of things like firewood, clay charcoal oven will be kept. Original traditional cooking
practices that often require longer cooking periods (1-3hours) will be used.

**Storage room** - For keeping food items for a long time

**Utility room** -  A room to keep tools for quick house maintenance like ladders, pliers, few nuts and bolts

**Mini garden** - A small space for me to plant a few vegetables and some fruits trees (guava, soursop, custard apple, pomegrenate, lemon, orange, mango), they trees might
look like plenty but you'd be surprised the amount of trees you can grow in a small place with proper pruning. It will talk about how
to [grow little fruit trees](https://www.amazon.com/Grow-Little-Fruit-Tree-Easy-Harvest/dp/1612120547) in another post

### Trees and flowers to plant

While I might not know all the types of flowers I will plant, there are some constants nevertheless. They are categorized into two;
the functional trees or plants and the cosmetics ones  

One rule of thumb I have when it comes to planting is to always take maintenance into consideration. How will the plant look like if there is no
one to take care of it? Will it completely destroy the whole outlook of the place it's planted?

**Sago Palm** - This is one of my favorites tree to plant. Its so beautiful yet very roughed in nature in that it's very drought tolerant,
it can survice under a lot of condition.
