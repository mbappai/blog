{/* I can't remember the number of times i've gone over my linkedin profile in hopes of optimizing it to best possible way I can, I was able
to achieve some level of professionalism some time back, however, I made the mistake of not documenting the process of how I did it.   */}

There are different sections to a linkedin profile but for the sake of brevity, I'm going to be focusing of most prominent sections

### Avatar, background Image and headline

**Avatar**: Your avatar or profile picture is one of the most important parts of your profile, because that is possibly the first thing people will
see. So what type of pictures should you upload? 

- Use a clean professional headshot, doesn't have to professionally taken by a photographer (though worth the investment) or anything. A nice headshot taken with your iphone
in potrait mode should be perfect.
- Make sure the picture has a nice background. Consider using a solid color, a nice gradient or a blurred background. Key takeaway here is that
nothing should distract the viewer from your headshot.
- Have a friendly expression on your face please, last thing you want is to intimidate people with a frowned or pissed off face

**Background Image**: This gives you the chance to express your personal brand to the profile, but it's okay if you haven't figured everything out yet, here's you get started

- Try to adhere to the recommended dimensions of linkedin which is **1584 pixels wide by 396 pixels tall**
