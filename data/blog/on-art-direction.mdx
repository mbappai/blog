There are hundreds if not thousands different ways to design anything. Without proper
art direction; if you're someone like me I would try to different font combinations for a given
project. There is no problem with that at all to be honest, but the problem comes when you don't know
the feeling you are trying to invoke in a user upon viewing that design most importantly for the first time and 
subsequent times as well.  

One of the easiest way for one to come up with a direction is to associate that brand with adjectives
you want to be known for. For example you could say upon viewing the design you want to invoke a feeling of
calmness, friendliness, security and trust in a user. With that in mind you could base your decisions on those
traits; constantly asking yourself after every step whether or not it is inline with the target traits.

I have been stuck on a single project for as long as I can remember simply because I had no clear
goals of the direction for the design. I have been trying multiple font combinations and layouts without
stopping to ask myself why I was making those calls.  

Now that I have set those directions, it makes it much easier for me to filter out a lot designs
not because they don't look good but because it doesn't fit the brand.
